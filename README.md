# Learning How to Learn
Welcome to the "Learning How to Learn" project! This project is my first submission for the Practicum 100 course, and I am excited to share it with you.

## Description
"Learning How to Learn" is a static website that serves as a guide to help you learn new things more effectively. The website provides a variety of general techniques that can be applied to any subject or skill you are trying to learn. These techniques will help you optimize your learning process, increase your retention of information, and improve your overall learning experience.

## Technology Used
This project was built using semantic HTML and CSS, following the BEM methodology. Semantic HTML provides a clear and meaningful structure to the website's content, while CSS is used to style and design the site, making it visually appealing and user-friendly.

I believe this site-guide will be an excellent resource for you on your journey of continuous learning and growth. Thank you for visiting, and please feel free to leave any feedback or suggestions!
